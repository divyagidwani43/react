the input is still not saved.... to save input we need to add listener
onChange will add data as it is entered and execute it as function (it is pointed to) says so
event describes the event that occurs 
when we log this event to console we get data we get a field called target that holds a value property 
that value property holds the value of the input now we can use the value we entered as
event.target.value
log it and see 


when we add a listener and process to javas we get an event object as default 
that same object we get here as well when we add a listener like onChange react gives a event object
when we log event to console after passsing it as parameter we get obj on log that has target as property that holds value
attribute that has out input value



function four (event){
  console.log(event)
}
<input onChange = {four}></input>
