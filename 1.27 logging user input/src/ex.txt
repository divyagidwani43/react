the input is still not saved.... to save input we need to add listener
onChange will add data as it is entered and execute it as function (it is pointed to) says so
event describes the event that occurs 
when we log this event to console we get data we get a field called target that holds a value property 
that value property holds the value of the input now we can use the value we entered as
event.target.value
log it and see
