the input is still not saved to save input we need to add listener

const [userInput,AddUserInput]=useState({
    amountAdded :'',
    DateAdded : ''
  })
using this we do not save any previous state of the amount and DateAdde

  const amount_date = (event) => {AddUserInput({
    ...userInput
    ,amountAdded:event.target.value
calling them like this also is not preffered as the value of amount added depends on userInput so it depends on previous values
which makes current value vulnerable
keep amountAdded and DateAdded as diff in above functions or thy may generate error

if your state update depends on previous state use 
  const enteredTitle =(event) =>{
    AddUserInput( (prevState)=>{
      return{  ...prevState,
        titleAdded:event.target.value
      }})}
