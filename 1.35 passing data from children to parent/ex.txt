we know how to move data from one js file to other using props but 
props can only be used when the main data is in main file parent file
i.e app has the main array of expenses where we call expenses that has expense item function both using props

to move it the other way ie from child node to parent we use a different approach
we need data to move from new expense that has all saved input to appjs to display it in expense tracker

we are listening to user input in expenseform.js as saving it titleAdded and other variable
using useState 
we log function that execute onChange or as we enter data those function give us the event data
that event data displays the data at target in value variable that is used to save the data we input in a variable declared using useState

react sees we added omChange as event listener to an input and executes it

we are till here using predefined function like onChange onClick that generate events 
we can also create our own function that will genearate an event of the name of out choice with any name
it is adviced to create with on in start this function we can define to allow us to pass data from parent to child and call function in child 
we can pass data to that func using props and tranfer data to parent from child

to reach app we need to get to newExpense
expenseform --> newExpense --> app
we can't skip any component in between data must be passed step by step

so we add a prop to newExpense where we call expenseform ------>newExpense





deine a custom function (onChange type) in the parent file point it to function that defines what to do with data
define props in child file and props.toCustomFunction(dataFunction) dataFunction is the funtion that holds the data we want to pass
pass that data as parameter and it reaches the parent file gets to the function
