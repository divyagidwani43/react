<a></a> can be <a />


it is seen as good practise to divide a major app to components while each component has its own function an deach
component has a different file
they can be connected using import expoert
we will define our componeents in components folder for clarity
we must most;y nam efiles starting from caps letter

function must always start from cap letter

there is one main file here its app.js which is connected to html file
all component are connected to this main file


to insert styling use className="" inside <>

if we open insepect on our doc we will see all our function in diff format (not jsx) in sources 

props are used to pass data from one componeents to other
