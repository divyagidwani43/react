the add expense button as such doesn't do anything 
it just reloads the form which is default behavior of react as we click on that button it send a req to server to do this
so to prevent that we     const any_name_defining_submit = (event)=>{
                             event.preventDefault();
and call it in            <form onSubmit = {any_name_defining_submit}>

we can also call it in           <button type="submit">Add Expense</button>
by using onClick but it would not stop default behavior of form in react to reload the form



  const any_name_for_func_defining_submit = (event)=>{
    event.preventDefault();                               //built in javas functin to stop default behavour of reload the page
    const any_name_2 ={
      title_variable_name_any : enteredTitle,
      amount_var :enteredAmount,
      date_var :new Date(enteredDate)
    }
    console.log(any_name_2)
  }



<form onSubmit = {any_name_for_func_defining_submit}>
