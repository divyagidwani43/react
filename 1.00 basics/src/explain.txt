JXS code stands for javascript in html


<a></a> can be <a />

it is seen as good practise to divide a major app to components while each component has its own function an deach component has a different file
they can be connected using import expoert
we will define our componeents in components folder for clarity
we must most;y nam efiles starting from caps letter

there is one main file here its app.js which is connected to html file
all component are connected to this main file
 

to insert styling use className="" inside <>
