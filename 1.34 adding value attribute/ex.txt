that for inputs we don't just listen to changes,
but we can also pass a new value back into the input.
So that we can reset or change the input programmatically.
          <input
            type="text"
            value = {enteredTitle}
            onChange={titleChange}
          ></input>
we add value here and assign it to its value we get throught useState
