TILL HERE we can only build static applications
where the state never changes, i.e output exactly the same.
You want to have applications which are interactive, so that you can React to clicks by the user
and to data being entered by the user and which are reactive so that the application
also changes when certain things happen.
SO HERE WE WILL SEE EVENTS i.e how to handle clicks and all
so we will see how to reach target state and control whats visible pn screen


      <button>what_you_want_printed</button>
will add a button

      <button onclick=>what_you_want_printed</button>
onclick will execute a function it is pointed to when the button is clicked

onclick is just a listener we add here the listeners can be added using on_theFunctionWeWant major listener start with on

ONE WAY onclick={  () => {} }
is to declare one line function and then button will do a told by function

you can add function like onclick to any <> eg div h2 etc as long as they supportt it
