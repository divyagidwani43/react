to re evalute the title we need to trigger react to notice a variable change otherwise it will ignore it

nomal varibales such as let changing its value cant cause react to re evalute the code again and display updated value


import React from "react";
is importing react 
import React ,{ useState} from "react";
imports the state function or  provided by react library. we can import other function as well or specific defined thing from react library in {}

useState() must be called inside function ExpenseItem ie main function (not in nested)

useState is a react hook and there are more hooks as well most start with use

useState defines a special variable and must have a default value 

useState returns an aray [intialValue, updatedValue] 

we use destructring to log those values to array of variable names of our choice

const [varibale_1 , variable_2] = useState(default_value)

variable_2 must be declared like variable_2(valueWanted) inside a function which when called will set the value
no function = no value in variable_2
variable_2(valueWanted)=only way
variable_2=valueWanted will error as variable_2 and varibale_1 have const in start
varibale_1 holds the value for default_value and when variable_2 is called or executed it updates its value and equates to variable_2

state is seperated on per component basis i.e clicking on change title of one expense item doesnt chnage for other 
i.e only one component is changed
