to re evalute the title we need to trigger react to notice a variable change otherwise it will ignore it
the funtion executes but the component where we deployed the funtion doesnt re executes
This ExpenseItem component function currently is not called a second time after the initial rendering
just because a click occurred or because a variable changed
does not trigger this component function to run again.So to tell React that it should run it again,
we need to import something from the React library.
after declaration we call the function and that needs to be done inside the component function not ouside or inside nested fnctiion or anywhere else


so we saw on adding let title = props.title;
  function Click(){
    title = 'hi';
    console.log('done')
  }
  and clicking on button the title doesnt change cause the react does not execute the code or the funtion again cause a variable was
  changed dur tp a click so to tell react to re do the funtion we use useState
  the above does executecheck the log

import React from "react";
is importing react 
import React ,{ useState} from "react";
imports the state function or  provided by react library
we can import other function as well or specific defined thing from react library in {}

useState() must be called inside function ExpenseItem ie main function (not in nested)
state is seperated on per component basis i.e clicking on change title of one expense item doesnt chnage for other 
i.e only one component is changed
