we want to pass data from new expense to expense to add it in tracker but there
is no sych connection to directly pass the data so to pass data we need to 
pass data through app.js as it is connected to both

new expense ----(lifting_state_up)---->app.js----(using_props)---->expenses


                    app.js

        new expense          expenses
