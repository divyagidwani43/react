whenever we click the button the pointed functin is executed but the title still doesn't change
the function does get triggered check using console log function

the component <expenseItem> as whole is just a component that also returns jsx code 
a function must be called 
but we never actually call these function but just use them as jsx code like <expenseItem> but it is a function defined in expenses
by using function as jsx code we make react aware of our components ie calling <expenseItem> makes react aware of expenseItem function
react evalutes the given jsx code returned then the jsx code their component function may return so almost all code is evaluated
now on button click a variable value changes but the react doesnt evaluates the whole code pieces all over again so it goes undetected
so to update in react and make react aware of update we use state function
