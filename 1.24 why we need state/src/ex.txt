the function does execute but doesnt reflect in title as how reacts compile jsx code
you can notice most of our function are called as <> in html code
when reacts evaluates jsx code it calls these component functions in<expemnseItem> for example
it keeps on evaluating jsc component codes and their respective function until no functions are left
the first func called in render </App> component
rect only dpes all the above once ie when the app is rendered but doesnt repeat the process 
so to update we must kmow what state is
